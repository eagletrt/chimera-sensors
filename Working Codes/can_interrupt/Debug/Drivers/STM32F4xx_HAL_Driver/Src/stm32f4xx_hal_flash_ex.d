  * @brief   RCC HAL module driver.
  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following
  *          functionalities of the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral:
  *           + Initialization and de-initialization functions
  *           + Peripheral Control functions

  ==============================================================================
                      ##### RCC specific features #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator
      (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache
      and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
      SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
      (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
          all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
      (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
      (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
          are assigned to be used for debug purpose.

    [..]
      Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
      (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
          (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
      (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings
      (+) Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
      (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
      (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
          derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)

                      ##### RCC Limitations #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral
      enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write
      from/to registers.
      (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
      (+) If peripheral is mapped on AHB: the delay is 2 AHB clock cycle
          after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register
      (+) If peripheral is mapped on APB: the delay is 2 APB clock cycle
          after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register

    [..]
      Implemented Workaround:
      (+) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
          inserted in each __HAL_RCC_PPP_CLK_ENABLE() macro.
