  * @brief   FLASH HAL module driver.
  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
  *          functionalities of the internal FLASH memory:
  *           + Program operations functions
  *           + Memory Control functions 
  *           + Peripheral Errors functions
  *

                        ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
  ==============================================================================
           
  [..] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AHB I-Code and D-Code accesses 
       to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations 
       and the read and write protection mechanisms.
      
  [..] The Flash memory interface accelerates code execution with a system of instruction
       prefetch and cache lines. 

  [..] The FLASH main features are:
      (+) Flash memory read operations
      (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
      (+) Read / write protections
      (+) Prefetch on I-Code
      (+) 64 cache lines of 128 bits on I-Code
      (+) 8 cache lines of 128 bits on D-Code
      
      
                     ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]                             
      This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH 
      memory of all STM32F4xx devices.
    
      (#) FLASH Memory IO Programming functions: 
           (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface using HAL_FLASH_Unlock() and 
                HAL_FLASH_Lock() functions
           (++) Program functions: byte, half word, word and double word
           (++) There Two modes of programming :
            (+++) Polling mode using HAL_FLASH_Program() function
            (+++) Interrupt mode using HAL_FLASH_Program_IT() function
    
      (#) Interrupts and flags management functions : 
           (++) Handle FLASH interrupts by calling HAL_FLASH_IRQHandler()
           (++) Wait for last FLASH operation according to its status
           (++) Get error flag status by calling HAL_SetErrorCode()          

    [..] 
      In addition to these functions, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
      to handle the following operations:
       (+) Set the latency
       (+) Enable/Disable the prefetch buffer
       (+) Enable/Disable the Instruction cache and the Data cache
       (+) Reset the Instruction cache and the Data cache
       (+) Enable/Disable the FLASH interrupts
       (+) Monitor the FLASH flags status
